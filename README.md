In this assignment, I altered all of the return commands so that the correct information would be returned when you run the program. It took some reading in order to understand (even slightly) what some of the commands were meant to do, but my part of the writing was really the simple part. There was some guess and check, especially once I reached the later lines that asked for information I didn't really understand. Overall, the program inputs a whole bunch of numbers and information and returns it when you run the program, from simple number problems to full phrases.
